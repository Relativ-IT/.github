# Welcome to Relativ-IT

## What for ?

Good question ! An organization with a unique member is a repo ! :smile:
It's not really intended to grow, but why not ?
The real goal is to "learn" some Github skills :wink: and to differenciate the guy, me, and a kind of "official" name I like.

## Why this name ?

I really like physic ! Things like Einstein **relativity**, this is the short answer.

The long answer is based on a logic, that come from Einstein's elevator experiment

> for an observer in an enclosed room, it is impossible to decide, by mapping the trajectory of bodies such as a dropped ball, whether the room is stationary in a gravitational field and the ball accelerating, or in free space aboard a rocket that is accelerating at a rate equal to that of the gravitational field versus the ball which upon release has nil acceleration.

That said, your IT will depend on the initial "observer" position and speed, and should fit your needs in a relative way against an absolute way

That's why all repositories here won't be absolutely perfect, but relatively fitted !
